# Candy Light Theme

Created due to the lack of visually explosive light syntax themes. Modeled after Shay Howe's example code in Learn to Code HTML & CSS.

Update: Fixed an issue where the html id attributes were the wrong color, changed the background color to be white, and added notebook-like borders to each line.
